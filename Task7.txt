Reflection:
	Spent about 8 to 10 hours. Had migraine most of it. I also didn't have my medication during it, that also made it harder to concentrate. I learned quite a lot about classes, mainly from the first task. I felt like Task 4 was easier than the ones before it.

	In Task 4 it says that each suit has 14 ranks. That should be changed to 13.
